# Gyro: A Three.js experiment

This project is a 3D version of [Flappy Space Program](http://corpsmoderne.itch.io/flappy-space-program). It uses Three.js to make the world, and mobile gyro sensors to change orientation.

Tap the screen, click the mouse or tap any key to fire your craft's thrusters. Don't overdo it or you will leave earth's gravity and fly off on an escape trajectory. It requires a bit of finesse to get it into a stable orbit. Once your ship has been flying unassisted for 5 seconds, a new one will spawn. If your ships hit each other, they will crash to earth.

If you zoom in, you'll notice a tiny satellite orbiting the Earth. There's also a moon, and a sun to provide light. None of these do anything, they were just fun to make. Nothing is to scale, obviously.

You might notice that the 'ship' looks like an enormous yellow rectangle. Well spotted! I haven't found a rocketship mesh model that I like yet. One day I'll probably change this.
